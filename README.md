Oh lost soul, since you stumbled upon this repository, let me enlighten you by telling you what it does.

This is a beta version of the analogue Solo on the Keyboard, its main difference is that you can learn touch ten-finger typing on the Colemak layout on it.
So far only English. (Later I will add other languages)

---
 + Also, if you are on Linux, then you do not need to install Colemak, it will automatically turn on and off.
 + If you are on Windows and see this error "qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "" This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem." - then copy the platforms folder from the Plugin folder of the PySide2 module to the folder where python is installed.
 + And on Windows (for now) you will have to manually install the Colemak layout and switch it.
 + And if you are on Mac OS, go to another system:3.

	For features - call.
	And may the ":w" be with you.
